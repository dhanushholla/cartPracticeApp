# 🛒 Cart Practice App

Welcome to the **Cart Practice App**! This project is a simple shopping cart application designed to help you practice essential frontend development skills, including search, sort, filter, reset filter, price calculation, and quantity count handling. The app is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for managing a list of products.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔍 Search

- **Product Search:** Users can search for products by name. The search function dynamically filters the product list based on the user's input, making it easy to find specific items.

### ⬆️ Sort

- **Sorting Options:** Users can sort products by price (low to high, high to low). The sorting feature updates the product list instantly, providing a clear view of the products based on the selected criteria price.

### 🗂️ Filter

- **Category Filter:** Users can filter products based on categories (e.g., electronics, clothing). Multiple filters can be applied at once, allowing for a customized product view.

### 🔄 Reset Filter

- **Reset Filters:** Users can reset all applied filters with a single click, returning the product list to its original state. This makes it easy to start a new search or filter process.

### 💲 Price Calculation

- **Total Price Calculation:** The app dynamically calculates the total price of items in the cart. As users add, remove, or adjust quantities, the total price is updated in real-time.

### ➕➖ Quantity Count Handling

- **Quantity Adjustment:** Users can easily increase or decrease the quantity of each product in the cart. The app ensures that the product's quantity is handled correctly, reflecting changes in both the cart's total count and the total price.
